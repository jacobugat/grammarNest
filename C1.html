-ing clauses
To express two actions performed by the same person or thing in a single sentence, we can include an -ing clause. An -ing clause contains an -ing participle.
The two actions happen at the same time or one action happens during another action.
The next day in class, my laptop crashed opening the file.
(My laptop crashed while / when it was opening the file.)
Trying to stay calm, I gave the presentation as best I could from memory.
(I was trying to stay calm while I gave the presentation.)
She is at her desk typing a paper.
(She is at her desk, and she is typing a paper.)
When one action happens before another action, use having + past participle. 
Having gotten several calls from me, my parents became really worried.
(My parents got several calls from me, and then they became really worried.)
Reasons and explanations for actions can also be expressed with -ing clauses.
Being too embarrassed to call him at home, I had to go to work after all to access the network. 
(Because I was too embarrassed to call him at home, I had to go to work.)
